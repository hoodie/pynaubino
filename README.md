# Naubino

An awesome 2D game with colors, basic physics and cycle tests in an undirected graph.

`pynaubino` is the multi front-end version of Naubino. It exists for fun.

See also [ naubino.js ]( http://naubino.de/ ) for a somewhat polished HTML5 Canvas version of Naubino.

Run with `naubino avg` or with `naubino` to see all possible front-ends.

## Python 3
* try 2to3 and think of Python 3 enabling the dependencies if possible
* it worked once but is not tested in any way right now

## TODO
* size of screen handling and placing of objects - rethink, 600x400 is spammed on several places
* grep -Hn TODO `find . -name '*py'` # ;-)

## DEV NOTES
* use pyqtProperty(type, get, set) instead of @pyqtProperty(type)â€¦ this is needed for Py2 compatibility
