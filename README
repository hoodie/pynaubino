== Naubino

=== Dependencies
* Python 2.6 >

* PyQt4 
** Qt 4.6 >

* pymunk 1.0.0
** chipmunk 5.3.2

=== Python 3
* try 2to3 and think of Python 3 enabling the dependencies

=== TODO
* abstract Qt dependencies away and implement stubs in Pig (QColor, ???)
* size of screen handling and placing of objects - rethink, 600x400 is spammed on several places
* grep -Hn TODO `find . -name '*py'` # ;-)

=== DEV NOTES
* use pyqtProperty(type, get, set) instead of @pyqtProperty(type)â€¦ this is needed for Py2 compatibility
